# Structure Factor and Form factor



Calculates the structure factor S(Q) or form factor F(Q) data using particle trajectories of molecular dynamics simulations.

1. The "main1.py" file is used to calculate the total scattering function I(Q)‚àùS(Q)F(Q) of the system.
2. The "main2.py" file is used to calculate the single-chain form factor F(Q).
